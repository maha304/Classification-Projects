üìä Financial Panel Dataset Analysis
This notebook showcases an in-depth analysis of a financial panel dataset. We'll dive into data exploration, feature engineering, and even a bit of model building to extract key insights. The dataset includes critical financial ratios that provide a deep look into the financial health and performance of different companies.

üåü Dataset Overview
Entries: 2,570
Columns: 13
Key Features: Financial ratios and a classification label (0 or 1) for each company
Unique Identifiers: The "code" column for different entities
Target Variable: Classification ‚Äì our dependent variable
The majority of columns consist of numerical data, making this a great candidate for predictive modeling.
